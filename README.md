The evolution of Ag nanoclusters by Monte Carlo simulation
The evolution of Ag nanoclusters on PEO surface under various electrodes and applied voltages was calculated by kinetic Monte Carlo simulation using Matlab. Code_01.m is used to simulate the cluster evoultion  and corresponding electric field distributions of basic two-terminal devices (Fig. 1e in the article). The physical evolution processes of two modulation units, i.e. distance modulation unit (Fig. 1i,j and Fig. S10 in the article) and voltage modulation unit (Fig. 1l,m and Fig. S11 in the article) are simulated by Code_02.m. Monte Carlo simulations of evolving process in the devices with metal islands in the article are carried out by Code_03.m (two-termial devices in Fig. S19) and Code_04.m (four-terminal devices in Fig. S24). Code_05 is used to study the physical process of artificial potential field evolution under the comprehensive control of electric field and ion mobility (Fig. S28,29 in the article).
